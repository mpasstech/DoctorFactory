As an owner of the app, you can build n number of groups depending upon an interest. Public channels can be accessed by anyone using the app while private ones come with a limitation of being open to a desired section of users. Although the public channels are open to all, it doesn't mean that users privacy will be hindered. Security, integrity and safety have been on top priority while designing the whole framework.

                            Via mobile apps, you can directly hear from your customers, be it their thoughts, their feedback, their reviews or anything else. A regular interaction is necessary to build an everlasting bond.
